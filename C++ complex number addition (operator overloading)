This is a functional problem i.e. partial code is already done for you, invest time to study the locked code and complete the solution accordingly.

In this problem, you need to add 2 given complex numbers and print the resulting complex number using '+' operator.

Implement a class named complex containing data members as real and imaginary part of the complex number and the following function:

void display()
constructor to assign values to the complex number.
operator function to add 2 numbers
Input:

First line of the input contains the number of test cases and each test case contains 4 space separated integer values representing the real and imaginary part of 2 complex numbers ( Real1 imaginary 1   real2 imaginary2 )
Output:

The output to each test case should be a single line representing the resulting complex number from the addition of given complex numbers. In the given format

real + imaginary_i

for eg:  2 +3i
Constraints:

1 <= Test case <= 100
Example:

Input:

2

3 6 -1 4

2 2 -1 -1

Output:

2 + 10i
1 + 1i
